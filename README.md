# Mechanical Task 1

This repository provides detailed files and documentation for designing a planetary gearbox using SolidWorks. Planetary gearboxes are widely used in various mechanical systems for their high torque density and compact size.

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive 3D model of a planetary gearbox, including all critical components. The design files are intended for use in SolidWorks for further analysis, customization, and manufacturing.

## Files Included

- **Sun Gear.SLDPRT**: Part file for the sun gear, which is the central gear in the planetary system.
- **Planetary Gear.SLDPRT**: Part file for the planet gears that revolve around the sun gear and mesh with the ring gear.
- **Ring Gear.SLDPRT**: Part file for the ring gear, which encircles the planet gears and engages with them.
- **Driver Shaft.SLDPRT**: Part file for the driver shaft, which transmits input to the sun gear.
- **Planetary Gearbox Assembly.SLDASM**: Assembly file that combines all components into a complete planetary gearbox.

## Design Features

- **High Precision**: Designed with high precision to ensure accurate gear meshing and smooth operation.
- **Modular Components**: Parts are designed as modular components to allow easy adjustments and replacements.
- **Detailed Assembly**: The assembly file provides a comprehensive view of how the parts fit together, including gear alignment and mounting features.

## Usage

- **SolidWorks Compatibility**: The files are compatible with SolidWorks 2022 and later versions. Ensure you have an appropriate version to open and edit the files.
- **Customization**: You can modify the design parameters to fit specific application requirements, including gear ratios, sizes, and mounting configurations.
- **Simulation**: Utilize SolidWorks Simulation tools to test the gearbox under various loads and conditions to validate the design.

## Technical Specifications

- **Material**: The design can be adapted for different materials based on strength requirements and manufacturing capabilities.
- **Gear Ratios**: Customizable based on the needs of your application.
- **Tolerance**: Designed with standard tolerances for ease of manufacturing and assembly.
